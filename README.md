## What I am gonna be trying to do
I am going to attempt to make at least 1 game and maybe a couple others. I am going to try and make the games Snake, Pong, and Tetris.

## Things I've learned about Python
- Run python by right-clicking on the file you want to run and press 'Run Python file in terminal'
- Sometimes you might get an error because maybe you have indentation that is off. It's very organized and looks for incorrect indentation stuff which I really like


## Snake
#### Some Vocab I learned
- *tkinter*: This is a package ("Tk interface") is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Tk itself isn't part of Python; it's maintained at ActiveState. Running python -m tkinter from the command line should open a window demonstrating the Tk interface. This lets you know that tkinter is properly installed and which version of Tcl/Tk is installed. 
- *pygame*: Cross-platform set of Python modules made for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries that are designed to be used in the Python language
- *Tkinter - MessageBox*: This is a widget that is used to display the message boxes in python application. It's kind of like an alert message.
- *import math*: Standard module in Python that is always available, it has mathematical functions.
- *pass*: The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code, nothing happens when this is used and avoids giving you an error if there is no code added yet since empty code is not allowed.
